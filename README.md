👋 Hi there ! I'm Lucie, a Junior Web Developer on a quest of growth and learning. 🚀

🌐 Currently, I'm immersed in the world of web development, honing my skills with Laravel, Vue.js & React.

📱 I'm also embarking on a new adventure 🚢 –> diving into the realms of Kotlin & mobile app development alongside Laravel 10. My goal is to not only update my skills but also to gain insights into the process of launching apps on platforms like the App Store.

🌟 I might (definitely) have neglected GitHub for a while, but I'm back and committed to sharing my coding journey 💡

Let's code 🖥️
